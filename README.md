**Know what's fair. Pay what's fair.**

## The Problem

Healthcare pricing in America is broken by design. The same MRI costs $400 at one facility and $4,000 at another provider in the same state. 80% of medical bills contain errors. The average large hospital bill has $1,300 in overcharges.

You can't comparison shop because prices are hidden. You can't fight your bill because you don't know what's fair. Meanwhile, less than 1% of people challenge their bills—even though 74% who do get them reduced.

## What Changed

Since 2021, federal law requires every hospital and insurer to publish their prices online. But they've deliberately made the data unweildy—technically public but practically inaccessible. JustPrice fixes that.

## What JustPrice Does

**For cash-pay and high-deductible patients in the SF Bay Area:**

**Price Search** — Look up any procedure. See nearby hospital's reported Good Faith Estimates. Know when you're being quoted 3x the fair price.

**Assistant** — Our AI agent contacts providers on your behalf to confirm prices, check availability, and ask about payment plans—so you never have to sit on hold.

**Bill Buster** — Upload your itemized bill. Bill Buster flags billing errors, upcoding, unbundled charges, and inflated prices. It shows you exactly what's wrong, explains why, and generates a dispute letter ready to send. If you successfully reduce your bill, pay 10% of your savings, up to a max of $500. That's it.

## Why It Matters

Every bill we fight teaches us which tactics work, which hospitals negotiate, and what fair prices are. We get smarter with every new user.

Most people don't have the time, knowledge, or patience to advocate for themselves while navigating our daunting healthcare system. Medical bills are the #1 cause of bankruptcy in America. We think that's wrong. *JustPrice fights for you.*
